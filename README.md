# LLM-based Session-Based Recommendation for Instacart

This repository contains the implementation of a **Candidate-Constrained Generative Recommendation Framework** using `Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct`. The project addresses the cold-start problem in session-based recommendation by leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 📌 Task Overview
The goal is to predict the next item a user will buy based on their purchase history. We focus on comparing the performance of **Zero-Shot LLM** against a traditional **BERT4Rec baseline** across different user groups (Cold-Start, Warm, Active).

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- **Python Version:** 3.8+
- **Hugging Face Account:** You need an access token to use the Inference API.

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
